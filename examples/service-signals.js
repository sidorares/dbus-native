				for each signals that is defined in your interface description object, there will be a new 'emit'
				function created that will simply fire the signal.
				Then, after one emit function is defined for the signal, this emit's function will be called.

				So really, everything that inside this emit function serves just as debugging or logging. If you're
				only interested in emitting a signal, then all you have to do is create this emit function in the
				interface objet, and do nothing. The signal swill be emitted just fine.

				Here, we are only putting some logging to show where the signals are emitted.
