	This test file's purpose is to show how to write a simple, basic DBus service with this library.
	In order to do that, we connect to the session bus and create a DBus service exposing some functions,
	some properties and some signals.

	For instance you can use `gdbus` to introspect a service and make function calls.
	- introspect: `gdbus introspect -e -d com.dbus.native.return.types -o /com/dbus/native/return/types`
	- make a method call: `gdbus introspect -e -d com.dbus.native.return.types -o /com/dbus/native/return/types -m com.dbus.native.return.types.FunctionName`
