	This example shows how to query a DBus service and listen for its signals.
	Since we're acting only as a client, there is not need to request a name: we don't need to register a service
	against the bus (but we could!), so we only act as a client.

	NOTE: this file is made to query the service that is exposed in the file 'server-signals.js', so be sure to
	start it first (node server-signals.js in another terminal should be enough)
)

// This is the service's DBus object path that we will query for the properties
